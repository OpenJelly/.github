# What is OpenJelly?

The OpenJelly Initiative is an open-source project aimed at revolutionizing mobile-first environments. By providing a text-based language and a dedicated IDE, we empower mobile developers to create more versatile and accessible Shortcuts breaking free from the limitations of traditional platforms.



# Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for each project can be found in their respective repositories:

- [Open-Jellycore Documentation](https://openjelly.github.io/Open-Jellycore/documentation/open_jellycore/)
- [Open-Jellycuts Documentation](https://github.com/Jellycuts/Open-Jellycuts#readme)
- [tree-sitter-jelly Documentation](https://github.com/Jellycuts/tree-sitter-jelly#readme)



## Community

Join our growing community of developers and contribute to the OpenJelly Initiative:

- **Developer Submissions and Listings**: Submit your Shortcuts on [RoutineHub.co](https://routinehub.co?ref=https://github.com/OpenJelly) and track their adoption.
- **Developer Interest**: Follow our projects and tutorials on RoutineHub's blog.
  - [Exploring IDEs for Apple Shortcuts](https://blog.routinehub.co/exploring-ides-for-apple-shortcuts/)

# FAQs

1. **I'm not great with Github or Git, where can I try Jelly and Jellycuts mobile IDE?**
   - Visit [jellycuts App](https://openjelly.com/ios) for Free Download. 

2. **What is Jelly language like?**
   - Many developers say that Jelly Language resembles Swift and Javascript. If you have experience with Javascript, you should be able to create shortcuts quickly.

3. **Why did you not use Javascript?**
   - Javascript is an expressive language but we found that it was not the right tool for creating Shortcuts. For example, await/async callbacks are a complex topic in Javascript that is unecessary with Shortcuts. Submitting a GET and POST request in Jelly is just easier to accmplish.

4. **Is there any way to integrate Javascript?**
   - Yes, many developers have found success adding Javascript to a WebView.

5. **Why would anyone want to create from a mobile phone?**
   - We wanted to provide better access to mobile-first developers who want to create while on the move. Plus, let's be honest, no one wants to lug around a laptop while they're:
     - Traveling and waiting at the airport. Instead ofpretending to be productive (but actually just doomscrolling), you can be productive.
     - Sitting on a beach, trying to justify the "working vacation" to your boss.
     - Stuck on public transport, where you can't escape the person next to you watching a drama series at full volume.
     - Waiting in line at the DMV, where time stands still and you wonder if youâ€™ll ever see daylight again.
     - Sitting through a boring meeting that could have been an email.

6. **Can Jellycuts support other languages?**
   - Jellycuts does support the Ruby language by way of the [Rubist app](https://rubyist.app?ref=https://github.com/openjelly).

7. **Can I create shortcuts using a Linux or Windows machine?**
   - Yes, by way of our [VS Code extension](https://openjelly.com/vscode) and downloading the [Open-Jellycore](https://github.com/Jellycuts/Open-Jellycore) compiler.

8. **I am already proficient with creating Shortcuts on my iOS device, why would I choose Jellycuts?**
   - Many developers will share that it's very difficult to create shortcuts beyond 50 actions. If you have a complex project, Jellycuts will make things easier to work with.

9. **I already created a shortcut and it's live on [RoutineHub](https://RoutineHub.co?ref=https://github.com/openjelly), how can I integrate it into Jellycuts?**
   - Jellycuts offers an import helper shortcut that will convert your shortcut into a JellycutsDictionary file. It's not 100% perfect but it will certainly help you save a lot of time.

10. **Is learning Jellycuts worth my time?**
    - If you are a new (or experienced) developer, Jellycuts can help you get your idea out into the world quickly. Rather than downloading a 13GB Xcode app, registering (and paying) for an Apple Developer account, and submitting your app for [App Store review](https://www.wired.com/story/developers-revolt-apple-dma/), you can write your core idea within Jellycuts in a fraction of that time, publish (and version control) your shortcut on [RoutineHub.co](https://RoutineHub.co?ref=https://github.co/openjelly), and get instant feedback from the larger RoutineHub community.

11. What is RoutineHub?
  - [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co?ref=https://github.com/OpenJelly) is a platform dedicated to Shortcuts, allowing users to discover, share, and download pre-made shortcuts for iOS and macOS devices. It's a community-driven marketplace where creators can showcase their work and users can streamline their daily routines with automation.

12. Why are we using their Discord?
  - The original original author of Jelly Lang and Jellycuts has partnered with RoutineHub to open source these tools and launch the [#OpenJelly](https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenJelly) initiative. Together, we aim to promote mobile-first development worldwide, starting with Shortcuts. RoutineHub's Discord hosts over 1800 members dedicated to Shortcuts and other forms of mobile-first technical development.
